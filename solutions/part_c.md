c) Additional Component to Enhance TWSBR and Proof of Concept
To make a TWSBR unique and enhance its capabilities, an additional component that can be added is a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor system. LiDAR technology uses laser light to measure distances, allowing the robot to create detailed 3D maps of its surroundings. By integrating LiDAR, the TWSBR can achieve the following:
•	Obstacle Detection and Avoidance: The LiDAR system can provide the robot with real-time data on its surroundings, enabling it to detect obstacles and plan optimal paths to navigate around them.
•	Enhanced Environmental Awareness: With LiDAR, the robot can have a more comprehensive understanding of its environment, including the ability to detect changes in terrain elevation and surface irregularities.
•	Improved Navigation Precision: The detailed 3D maps generated by LiDAR can enhance the robot's navigation precision, allowing for more efficient and safe movement in complex environments.
The proof of concept for integrating LiDAR can be demonstrated through simulations and real-world testing, showcasing the robot's improved obstacle avoidance, navigation efficiency, and overall environmental awareness
