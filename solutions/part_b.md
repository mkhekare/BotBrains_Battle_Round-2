b) Core Concept of Two Wheeled Self-Balancing Robots (TWSBR)
The core concept of two-wheeled self-balancing robots (TWSBR) revolves around their ability to maintain an upright position without toppling over, akin to an inverted pendulum system. This is achieved through a combination of advanced sensor technologies, dynamic control systems, and autonomous navigation capabilities.Key elements of the core concept include:
•	Gyroscopes and Accelerometers: These sensors detect the robot's orientation and provide crucial data for the control system to make adjustments to maintain balance.
•	Dynamic Control Systems: Sophisticated control algorithms continuously analyze sensor data and make rapid adjustments to the robot's movements to ensure balance.
•	Autonomous Navigation: TWSBRs are designed to navigate complex environments autonomously, allowing them to carry out tasks such as personal transportation or last-mile delivery with minimal human intervention.
The core concept of TWSBRs is rooted in their ability to dynamically adjust their movements based on sensor feedback to remain balanced on two wheels while carrying out various tasks
