a) Parameters for Calculating Maximum Angle of Inclination in Two Wheeled Self-Balancing Robots (TWSBR)
The maximum angle of inclination in two-wheeled self-balancing robots (TWSBR) is a crucial parameter that determines the robot's ability to maintain balance. Several key parameters need to be considered when calculating this angle:
1.	Center of Mass (CoM) Position: The position of the center of mass relative to the wheels affects the robot's stability. A lower CoM enhances stability, allowing for a larger maximum angle of inclination.
2.	Wheelbase: The distance between the two wheels impacts the robot's ability to resist tipping over. A wider wheelbase generally allows for a larger maximum angle of inclination.
3.	Wheel Size and Traction: The size and traction of the wheels influence the robot's ability to maintain balance at different inclinations.
4.	Control System Responsiveness: The speed and effectiveness of the control system in adjusting the robot's orientation play a significant role in determining the maximum angle of inclination.
5.	Sensor Accuracy and Responsiveness: The accuracy and responsiveness of the gyroscopes and accelerometers used for detecting the robot's orientation are critical factors in calculating the maximum angle of inclination.
The calculation of the maximum angle of inclination involves a complex interplay of these parameters to ensure the robot's stability and balance while in operation
