d) Programming TWSBR for Parcel Delivery and Navigation
To program the TWSBR for delivering parcels to consumers' doorsteps while navigating traffic, turns, and obstacles, the following steps can be taken:
1.	Sensor Integration: Integrate gyroscopes, accelerometers, and LiDAR sensors to provide real-time data on the robot's orientation, surroundings, and obstacles.
2.	Path Planning Algorithm: Develop a path planning algorithm that takes into account traffic patterns, road conditions, and obstacle detection from the LiDAR system to plan the most efficient route to the delivery destination.
3.	Traffic Navigation: Implement a traffic navigation system that utilizes real-time traffic data to make decisions on route adjustments and lane changes.
4.	Obstacle Avoidance: Utilize the LiDAR data to detect and avoid obstacles, adjusting the robot's trajectory as necessary to navigate around them.
5.	Control System: Develop a robust control system that incorporates the data from all sensors and executes precise movements to maintain balance, navigate turns, and adjust speed based on the environment.
