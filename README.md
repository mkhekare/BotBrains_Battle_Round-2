# Two Wheeled Self-Balancing Robots (TWSBR)

Two Wheeled Self-Balancing Robots (TWSBR) are an exciting development in the field of robotics, blending advanced sensor technologies, dynamic control systems, and autonomous navigation capabilities. These robots are designed to balance on two wheels while carrying out various tasks, such as personal transportation or last-mile delivery. By using gyroscopes and accelerometers, TWSBRs can detect their orientation and adjust their movements to maintain balance. The integration of sophisticated algorithms allows them to navigate complex environments, making them ideal for applications in both research and practical implementations. 

## Project Overview

This repository explores the key aspects of designing, enhancing, and programming TWSBRs to optimize their performance and utility.

### Questions Addressed

1. **Parameters for Calculating Maximum Angle of Inclination**
   - Discusses the parameters to be considered for calculating the maximum angle of inclination in TWSBRs.

2. **Core Concept of TWSBR**
   - Explains the core concept of TWSBRs, focusing on balance control using sensors and feedback mechanisms.

3. **Unique Component Addition**
   - Introduces an additional component to make the TWSBR unique, providing a proof of concept.

4. **Programming the Robot for Parcel Delivery**
   - Details the approach to programming the robot for delivering parcels, navigating traffic, turns, and other obstacles.
